# Simple Computer System

## Intro
This repo implements a simple computer system based on i386 framework, which can load and run a GUI game smoothly.

## Workflows
- install and config linux virtual machine(Debian GNU/Linux 9 (i386))
- add basic ALU functions(arithmetic and logic operation)
- support float floating point number computing
- simulate i386 instruction set
- add ELF loader
- simulate cache storage
- support logical address, linear address, physical address
- handle exceptions and interrupts, add timer
- react to I/O devices like keyboard and screen
- run a GUI game
